# Stock Market API - Backend in Python

This is the backend API for a stock market web application. The backend is built using Flask and provides an endpoint to retrieve stock market data for a specific stock symbol.

## Features

- **Retrieve stock data**: Fetches daily stock data (opening, closing, and price variation) for a given stock symbol using the Alpha Vantage API.
- **Error handling**: Returns a 400 error if no stock symbol is provided or if the symbol is not found.
- **Future feature**: In the future, we plan to implement a notification system that will alert users when a stock's price changes beyond a specified threshold.
